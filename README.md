In order to use registration and login functionality, node.js package should be applied.
Before opening web pages, we need to install node_modules using command: npm install

We can use it in terminal

and also we should connect to localhost:port/account

in my case, port = 3000

using the command 

node backend/index.js

we will be able to connect to our localhost server

and then in browser, we should go to this address

localhost:3000

after all of that, we can use our web pages
